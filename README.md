# jsonote (제이쏘노트)

**A JSON-based, GitHub-integrated note-taking application designed for sovereignty, scalability, and security.**

`jsonote` is a specialized note-taking tool that stores everything in JSON format, leveraging GitHub repositories as its primary storage engine while maintaining full local compatibility.

## 🌟 Core Values

1.  **Scalability (확장성)**: Works across multiple repositories and handles large volumes of data with a structured JSON format.
2.  **Data Sovereignty (데이터 주권성)**: You own your data. Stored in your GitHub repos or local files, never locked into a proprietary system.
3.  **Security (보안성)**: Leverages GitHub's robust security model and industry-standard JSON/Git workflows.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **JSON First**: All notes, metadata, and configurations are stored as clean, portable JSON files.
-   **GitHub Integration**: Seamlessly sync, commit, and push notes to one or more GitHub repositories.
-   **Hybrid Workflow**: Works both locally (with built-in Git support) and remotely via GitHub APIs.
-   **Structured Input**: Optimized forms for common note types alongside a flexible free-text editor.
-   **Git-Powered**: Automatic versioning through Git-like operations (commits, branches, sync).

## 🚀 Getting Started
