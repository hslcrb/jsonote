## 1. Token Safety
Your GitHub Personal Access Token is stored in your browser's `localStorage`. It is never sent to our servers. All GitHub API calls are made directly from your browser to GitHub (Client-side) or through your private proxy if configured.

## 2. Local Font Serving
This application serves all fonts locally to prevent external tracking and ensure offline availability.

## 3. Private Data
JSONOTE does not have a backend database for notes. Everything is stored in **your** GitHub repository.
